<p>She strolled down the corridor, hands in her pockets. The walls were painted concrete with the occasional poster about the Chiasm Syndicate’s operations, and the linoleum clacked beneath her clawed feet as she made her way.</p>

<p>The sign on the door said ‘executive offices’. She stood on her toes, peeking through the window — another corridor, lined with doors. The map near the entrance had said the ‘Director’s office’ was this way. She stepped away from the door and turned to the security guard standing next to it.</p>

<p>“I want to open the door,” she said, clearly. Her accent was still pretty strong, but her English had been getting better, and usually worked.</p>

<p>“I…” the guard said, her brow furrowing, as if she couldn’t remember something.</p>

<p>“I need to open the door now,” she said. Maybe it was the phrasing?</p>

<p>The guard nodded to herself, turned to the door, punched in a code, and started to open the door.</p>

<p>The intruder concentrated, and the fact that she’d just thought that <em>I need to open the door now</em> slipped the guard’s mind entirely. The guard paused and blinked, before shaking her head and letting the door swing closed, but not before the intruder had slipped past, ducking under her arm and into the executive corridor. If she’d seen the small, purple-skinned figure who’d just walked past her, her brain didn’t let her register it.</p>

<p>The executive corridor had <em>carpet</em>. She was grateful for the quiet as she padded down between the plain wooden office doors, glancing from nameplate to nameplate. Dr A. Hemsley’s door was identical to any other, not embellished, just named. The client had said in their letter that the Doc kept important, classified documents in her office. Exactly <em>how</em> the client was aware of this, she wasn’t quite sure, but the letter — she insisted on letters; face-to-face didn’t work, and apparently no-one could hear her on a phone, either — had been quite insistent, and the client had paid up-front, so here she was. Certainly a bit of a change from bank robbery — this new “Benefactors’ League” was starting to ask around about tellers suddenly deciding to shove money into bags, then forgetting those bags existed after mysteriously losing them.</p>

<p>Reminiscence over, she reached out, turned the handle, and gently pushed the door open. Beyond, the office wasn’t huge — a desk, a bookshelf, and a window that overlooked the street. The desk was inhumanly neat — papers stacked square in the “in” and “out” trays, pens arranged by order of size and colour, notebooks and other stationery regimented across the surface of the desk to a degree of precision that was almost <em>alarming</em>. And, behind the desk, Doctor A. Hemsley — <em>Alice</em> Hemsley, according to the nameplate on the desk — sat, looking through a sheaf of slightly distressed and crumpled papers, which were jarringly out-of-place, compared to the rest of her meticulous office. She was a woman somewhere between her thirties and fifties, with a complexion that either suggested that she was from somewhere around the Mediterranean, or that she saw a lot of sun.</p>

<p>She looked up as the door swung shut, piercing golden eyes looking straight through the intruder, almost directly meeting her gaze, as if that were possible. For a long second, neither woman moved. And then the moment passed, she adjusted her reading glasses, and returned to her weird papers.</p>

<p>The intruder released a breath she hadn’t realised she was holding. Silly, really. It didn’t matter how much noise she made, anymore, but old habits were old habits. She circled around the room to look over Hemsley’s shoulder, squinting at the papers she was holding — it looked like they’d been crumpled up, then straightened out and flattened. She leaned closer to take a closer look — what first seemed like thick green pen was actually <em>crayon</em>. Who wrote a report, an actual <em>technical</em> report, in <em>crayon?</em> Reading this random page of it didn’t really tell her anything — at least part of it was written in a language she didn’t know or recognise the alphabet of, and the rest looked like some kind of mathematics, which she could make neither head nor tail of, some doodles in the margins of… stuff?</p>

<p><em>Maybe the client would be interested,</em> she thought. She was nearly leaning on Hemsley’s shoulder at that point, trying to make sense of the weird crumpled papers that the doctor was slowly leafing through. Since they didn’t seem to be getting any more interesting or making any more sense, she made a mental note to take another look at it when Hemsley put it down, and turned instead to one of the filing cabinets that sat behind her. Creaking it open, she skimmed over the neatly-labelled dividers; Abilities, Acquisition, Admin… she skipped past a few folders… <em>Dimensional Research</em> looked interesting. She pulled the thin beige folder out, put it down on the desk in a spare space, and flipped it open. She was greeted by a wave of bizarre mathematics, hand-drawn diagrams of strange devices, and a mugshot of a youngish-looking man glaring at the camera, holding a board imprinted with “<strong>HYWEL ‘SCHISM’ JONES</strong>”. She <em>vaguely</em> recognised him — she’d seen reports of Schism on the news a couple of years ago. A supervillain who opened portals to ‘other Earths’ — the reports had been vague.</p>

<p>This seemed like something the client might want to see, so she reached her satchel for her camera, manoeuvring around the table until she was in the right light, and snapping a photo, as clear as she could. The camera buzzed as the photo slid out, and she gently took it and placed it on the table next to the document as she waited for it to develop. She’d need to take quite a few photos, in order to get the documents relatively <em>legible</em>. If this turned out to be what the client wanted, she’d come back and actually <em>steal</em> it at a later date — they’d said in their letter that they wanted the Syndicate to know as little of what was missing as possible, so she decided to play it safe. A little while later, she’d taken the photos and labelled them. Alice Hemsley had, meanwhile, pulled an apple, a small plate and a knife from a drawer in her desk, peeled the apple in one long, spiralling piece of skin, sliced it neatly up, and eaten it as she finished reading her weird crayon documents, before placing them in a neat folder and filing them under ‘Prognostication’, which was one of the oddly-named dividers that she’d noticed before. Hemsley sat back down, and the intruder took the opportunity to step over to the drawer and pull the folder out again. She took a few more pictures of the weird crayon scribblings. If the client wanted the Chiasm Syndicate’s secrets, these seemed suitably <em>strange</em>.</p>

<p>These seemed like pretty much all the interesting things she had been sent to find. She took a picture of the labels in the filing cabinets, in case the client wanted to hire her for some old-fashioned industrial espionage in future, packed up all the documents she’d found back in their original folders, gathered up all her photos into neat sleeves in her bag, briefly considered and rejected the idea of finding a photocopier — she’d do that if she came back, so she could avoid spending half an hour photocopying the <em>wrong</em> documents. All the while, Dr Hemsley had been reading through some kind of internal briefing, making notes and fixing spelling mistakes with a blue pen.</p>

<p>She turned to leave, shouldering her bag, and stopped.</p>

<p>Dr Alice Hemsley was leaning against the door, continuing to read the briefing, pen in hand.</p>

<p><em>When did she move?</em> She hadn’t heard her move. She’d just looked away for a second, and… <em>did she know she was here? How was that possible?</em></p>

<p>She collected herself, then spoke. “I’m blocking the door. What if someone else came in?”</p>

<p>In response, Dr Hemsley reached down, locked the door, and returned to flipping through the papers she was holding.</p>

<p>The intruder stood there, stupefied, for a moment. <em>Was this on purpose?</em> She looked around the office desperately, for a distraction, for <em>something</em>. Inspiration struck, and she reached over the desk, picked up one of Hemsley’s neatly-arranged pens and placed it back down at an angle. Against the strict order of the desk, it stood out like a sore thumb.</p>

<p>“That pen’s in the wrong place,” she said, looking over at Hemsley. “I should fix that.”</p>

<p>Doctor Hemsley looked up, sighed, then strode over to the desk. The intruder darted towards the door, reaching out for the handle, claws fumbling with the lock. And then someone placed a hand on her shoulder and uttered four words that were, in context, the most terrifying ones she’d ever heard.</p>

<p>“Don’t leave just yet,” said Doctor Alice Hemsley. “I’d like to have a word.”</p>
